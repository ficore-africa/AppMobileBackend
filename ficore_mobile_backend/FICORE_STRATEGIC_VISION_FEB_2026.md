# FiCore Africa: Strategic Vision & Roadmap
**Date:** February 5, 2026

## The Core Identity

**FiCore Africa is the Intelligence Layer for African Commerce**

We are not "just another fintech." We are an **Automated Financial Guardian** that solves the two biggest pain points in the Nigerian market:

1. **Administrative Chaos** - Messy, incomplete financial records
2. **Compliance Anxiety** - Fear of tax audits and penalties

---

## The Product Evolution

### Phase 1: Passive Recorder (✅ COMPLETE)
**The "Audit Shield"**

- **Voice & Text Entry:** Natural language in English, Hausa, Pidgin
- **Context-Aware Intelligence:** Auto-categorization of tax-deductible items
- **Progress Bar:** "Audit Readiness Score" (users at 75% filing-ready)
- **Tax Dashboard:** Live tracking toward PIT (March 31) and CIT (June 30) deadlines

**Status:** Live and proven with active user base

### Phase 2: Active Spender (🚀 IN PROGRESS)
**The "Spending Wallet"**

- **Truth Source:** Wallet knows transactions in real-time
- **Automated Record Generation:** Bookkeeping happens in the background
- **Utility Hub:** VTU services (Airtime/Data/Electricity) drive 3-5x daily engagement
- **Dual-Rail Subscriptions:** Monnify/Paystack + Internal Wallet (zero gateway fees)

**Status:** VTU live, wallet payments active, automated records in development

### Phase 3: Everyday Necessity (🎯 NEXT)
**The "Intelligence Layer"**

Three critical capabilities to achieve "Everyday Necessity" status:

1. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
   - Removes friction of manual entry
   - Snap receipt → Auto-categorized entry
   - The "Lazy User's" dream

2. **Open Banking Integration**
   - Captures transactions outside FiCore Wallet
   - Syncs GTB, Zenith, Access Bank accounts
   - Maintains complete Audit Shield coverage

3. **Full-Fledged Spending Wallet**
   - Captures float and transaction margins
   - Becomes primary payment method
   - Path to "Legacy" company status

**Phase 3+ Eligibility Criteria:**

Before adding new features to Phase 3, verify:
- ✅ OCR is live and proven (receipt scanning works reliably)
- ✅ Open Banking is integrated (3+ banks syncing)
- ✅ Full spending wallet is operational (P2P transfers, merchant payments)
- ✅ Merchant network established (100+ partners)
- ✅ User data shows demand (20%+ of active users requesting feature)

**Phase 3+ Potential Features:**
- Lightweight invoicing (as part of merchant suite)
- Advanced inventory management (for retail businesses)
- Multi-currency support (for international traders)
- API access for accountants/bookkeepers
- White-label solutions for corporate clients

A trader in Sabon Gari, Kano, or a hustler in Yaba doesn't want to "issue an invoice." They want to receive money and know they are safe from the tax man. Invoicing is a Western accounting construct that doesn't fit the high-velocity, cash-and-transfer reality of the Nigerian informal sector. We are in the Active Spender phase. Our job right now is to make sure every time a user buys data, our "plumbing" is so good that the expense entry appears perfectly. If we spend 3 months on CSS letterheads, we lose the window to dominate the VAS-to-Bookkeeping market.

Next Steps: Use the Feature Prioritization Framework for all future feature requests. When in doubt, ask: "Does this make bookkeeping more automatic?"

## The Business Model

### Revenue Streams

#### 1. FiCore Credits (FC) - Our Internal Currency
- **What:** Virtual currency for premium features and services
- **Pricing:** ₦1 = 1 FC (1:1 parity for simplicity)
- **Initial Balance:** New users start with **10 FC** (welcome bonus)
- **Use Cases:** 
  - Premium subscription payments
  - VAS transaction fees (future)
  - Merchant payments (future)
- **Advantage:** Zero gateway fees, instant settlement, higher margins
- **Strategy:** Small initial balance creates urgency to either subscribe (unlimited) or purchase more FC

#### 2. Wallet Deposit Fees
- **Deposit Fee:** ₦30 per deposit (free tier users only)
- **Gateway Fees:** 1.6% (Monnify standard rate)
- **Premium Benefit:** ₦0 deposit fee (waived for premium subscribers)
- **Strategy:** Loss leader to build wallet balance (future float revenue)
- **Example:** 
  - Free user deposits ₦1,000 → Gateway fee ₦16 → Deposit fee ₦30 → User gets ₦970 FC
  - Premium user deposits ₦1,000 → Gateway fee ₦16 → Deposit fee ₦0 → User gets ₦1,000 FC
- **Net Revenue:** ₦14 per deposit (₦30 fee - ₦16 gateway cost)

#### 3. Subscription Revenue
- **Monthly Premium:** ₦1,000/month
  - 30-day duration
  - Unlimited entries
  - Zero deposit fees (saves ₦30 per deposit)
  - Advanced tax reports
  - Priority support
  - Export capabilities
  
- **Annual Premium:** ₦10,000/year (₦833/month - saves ₦2,000)
  - 365-day duration
  - All monthly features
  - 2 months free
  - Annual tax filing support
  
- **Payment Methods:**
  - Card/Bank (via Monnify/Paystack) - 1.6% gateway fee
  - FiCore Wallet (via FC) - 0% gateway fee ✅ Higher margin
  
- **Unit Economics:**
  - Monthly via card: ₦1,000 - ₦16 (1.6%) = ₦984 net
  - Monthly via wallet: ₦1,000 - ₦0 = ₦1,000 net (100% margin)
  - Annual via card: ₦10,000 - ₦160 (1.6%) = ₦9,840 net
  - Annual via wallet: ₦10,000 - ₦0 = ₦10,000 net (100% margin)

#### 4. VAS Commissions (Airtime/Data/Bills)

**Current Policy:** Face value pricing (no markup to users)

**Commission Rates:**
- **Data Plans:**
  - Peyflex: 5% commission (preferred for data)
  - Monnify: 3% commission
  
- **Airtime:**
  - Monnify: 3% commission (preferred for airtime)
  - Peyflex: 1% commission

**Volume Strategy:**
- Small commissions × High frequency = Sustainable revenue
- Average user: 10-15 VAS transactions/month
- Example: ₦50,000 monthly VAS volume × 3-5% = ₦1,500-₦2,500 revenue/user/month

**User Choice Philosophy:**
- Transparent pricing (users see both provider prices)
- No artificial nudges or "recommended" badges
- Let API prices guide user choice naturally
- Commission strategy optimized but user-first

#### 5. Referral Program Revenue Impact
- **First Deposit Bonus:** ₦30 deposit fee waived + 5 FC (cost to us)
- **Subscription Commission:** ₦2,000 per referred subscription (7-day vesting)
- **VAS Share:** 1% of referee's VAS transactions for 90 days
- **Minimum Withdrawal:** ₦1,000

#### 6. Future Revenue Streams (Phase 3)
- **Float Revenue:** Interest on wallet balances (when licensed)
- **Merchant Fees:** 0.5-1% on business transactions
- **OCR Premium:** ₦500/month for unlimited receipt scanning
- **Open Banking Sync:** ₦200/month per connected bank account
- **API Access:** B2B revenue from accountants/bookkeepers

### Unit Economics Summary

**Per User Monthly Revenue Potential:**
- Subscription: ₦1,000 (or ₦833 if annual)
- Deposit fees: ₦30 × 3 deposits = ₦90 (free tier only)
- VAS commissions: ₦50,000 volume × 4% avg = ₦2,000
- **Total potential:** ₦3,000-₦3,900/user/month

**Margin Optimization:**
- Wallet payments: 100% margin (₦0 gateway fees)
- Card payments: 98.4% margin (1.6% gateway fees)
- VAS commissions: 100% margin (provider pays us)
- Deposit fees: 46.7% margin (₦14 net after ₦16 gateway cost)

### Market Timing Strategy
- **March 31 (PIT Deadline):** Viral trigger for individual upgrades
- **June 30 (CIT Deadline):** Corporate subscription surge
- **Tax Season = Growth Season**

### Scale Factor
**The 10,000th user costs us almost nothing to serve**

- Automated record generation
- Self-service tax dashboard
- Volume + Math engine (not labor-intensive)

- Automatic records, real-time tracking
- Everyday necessity

**THE RESULT:**
- Bookkeeping happens as a **by-product of living**, not a chore
- True "Utility to Necessity" transformation

## The Vision Statement

**"FiCore Africa: Where your spending becomes your bookkeeping, and your compliance becomes automatic."**

We are building the financial operating system for African SMEs and individuals. Not a tool they use once a month, but the platform they live on every day.

---

## Competitive Advantages

**FiCore's Core Competitive Moats:**

1. **Tax Intelligence (Audit Shield):** No competitor has our context-aware tax categorization
2. **Automated Bookkeeping:** Spending → Records pipeline is unique (bookkeeping as a by-product)
3. **Cultural Localization:** Hausa + Pidgin = Northern + Southern Nigeria coverage
4. **Wallet Integration:** Zero-friction payments = higher conversion and retention
5. **Compliance Focus:** We solve the #1 fear (tax audits and penalties)

**Strategic Positioning:**
> "FiCore's competitive advantage is tax intelligence and automated bookkeeping. Any feature that dilutes this positioning, distracts from core value, or competes with established tools should be declined."

### Feature Prioritization Framework

**✅ BUILD (Aligned with Core Promise):**
- Features that automate bookkeeping (OCR, Open Banking, auto-entries)
- Features that enhance tax intelligence (deduction tracking, audit readiness)
- Features that increase daily engagement (VAS services, wallet payments)
- Features that reduce friction (voice entry, instant updates, offline support)

**⏸️ DEFER (Phase 3+ Only):**
- Features that require manual work (invoicing, inventory management)
- Features that compete with established tools (full accounting software)
- Features that serve niche segments (< 20% user demand)
- Features that add complexity without automation

**❌ DECLINE (Strategic Misalignment):**
- Features that contradict "bookkeeping as a by-product" promise
- Features that dilute product positioning
- Features that distract from Phase 2 priorities
- Features that add maintenance burden without strategic value

### Example: Invoicing Feature Analysis (Feb 2026)

**Proposal:** CSS-based letterhead invoicing with monogram logos  
**Technical Merit:** ✅ Sound (small file size, no image uploads, crisp rendering)  
**Strategic Fit:** ❌ Misaligned

**Reasons for Decline:**
1. **User Segments:** Primary users (freelancers, traders, hustlers) don't need formal invoicing
2. **Product Promise:** Invoicing is active work, not passive recording (violates core promise)
3. **Phase Misalignment:** Belongs to Phase 3+ (Intelligence Layer), not Phase 2 (Active Spender)
4. **Competitive Position:** Not unique (Wave, Zoho, QuickBooks already do this well)
5. **Scope Creep:** 3-month project disguised as 1-week feature (templates, branding, tracking)

**When to Revisit:**
- ✅ Phase 3+ conditions met:
  - OCR is live and proven
  - Open Banking is integrated
  - Full spending wallet is operational
  - Merchant network established (100+ partners)
  - User data shows demand (20%+ requesting it)
- **Then:** Consider lightweight invoicing as part of merchant suite

**For Now:** Stay focused. Stay lean. Stay true to the promise.

## The Path Forward

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)
1. Stabilize VTU services (99.9% success rate)
2. Optimize wallet performance (sub-second updates)
3. Complete automated record generation
4. Launch OCR research/vendor evaluation

### Short-Term (Next 90 Days)
1. OCR MVP (receipt scanning)
2. Open Banking API integration (pilot with 1 bank)
3. Merchant partnership program design
4. DevOps infrastructure upgrade

### Medium-Term (Next 180 Days)
1. Full OCR rollout
2. Open Banking expansion (3+ banks)
3. POS integration pilot
4. Merchant network launch (10 partners)

## Closing Reflection

**"We are no longer just managing data; we are managing the lifeblood of our users' businesses."**

The transition from Passive Recorder to Active Spender to Everyday Necessity is not just a product roadmap—it's a fundamental shift in how Nigerians think about money management.

When a user buys data at 7 AM, pays for breakfast at 9 AM, and settles a supplier invoice at 2 PM—all through FiCore—and their tax dashboard updates automatically in the background... that's when we've achieved our mission.

That's when bookkeeping becomes invisible.  
That's when compliance becomes automatic.  
That's when FiCore becomes indispensable.

---

## The Strategic Discipline

**"Stay focused. Stay lean. Stay true to the promise."**

As FiCore grows, the temptation to add features will increase. User requests, competitive pressure, and technical feasibility will all push us toward feature bloat.

**Our North Star:**
- ✅ Tax Intelligence (Audit Shield)
- ✅ Automated Bookkeeping (spending → records)
- ✅ Cultural Localization (Hausa + Pidgin)
- ✅ Wallet Integration (zero-friction payments)

**Our Discipline:**
- ❌ Decline features that require manual work
- ❌ Decline features that compete with established tools
- ❌ Decline features that dilute product positioning
- ❌ Decline features that distract from current phase priorities

**The Test:**
> "Does this feature make bookkeeping more automatic, or does it add manual work?"

If the answer is "adds manual work," the feature doesn't belong in FiCore—no matter how technically elegant or user-requested it may be.
