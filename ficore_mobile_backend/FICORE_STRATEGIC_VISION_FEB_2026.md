## The Core Identity

**FiCore Africa is the Intelligence Layer for African Commerce**

We are not "just another fintech." We are an **Automated Financial Guardian** that solves the two biggest pain points in the Nigerian market:

1. **Administrative Chaos** - Messy, incomplete financial records
2. **Compliance Anxiety** - Fear of tax audits and penalties

---

## The Product Evolution

### Phase 1: Passive Recorder (✅ COMPLETE)
**The "Audit Shield"**

- **Voice & Text Entry:** Natural language in English, Hausa, Pidgin
- **Context-Aware Intelligence:** Auto-categorization of tax-deductible items
- **Progress Bar:** "Audit Readiness Score" (users at 75% filing-ready)
- **Tax Dashboard:** Live tracking toward PIT (March 31) and CIT (June 30) deadlines

**Status:** Live and proven with active user base

### Phase 2: Active Spender (🚀 IN PROGRESS)
**The "Spending Wallet"**

- **Truth Source:** Wallet knows transactions in real-time
- **Automated Record Generation:** Bookkeeping happens in the background
- **Utility Hub:** VTU services (Airtime/Data/Electricity) drive 3-5x daily engagement
- **Dual-Rail Subscriptions:** Monnify/Paystack + Internal Wallet (zero gateway fees)

**Status:** VTU live, wallet payments active, automated records in development

### Phase 3: Everyday Necessity (🎯 NEXT)
**The "Intelligence Layer"**

Three critical capabilities to achieve "Everyday Necessity" status:

1. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**
   - Removes friction of manual entry
   - Snap receipt → Auto-categorized entry
   - The "Lazy User's" dream

2. **Open Banking Integration**
   - Captures transactions outside FiCore Wallet
   - Syncs GTB, Zenith, Access Bank accounts
   - Maintains complete Audit Shield coverage

3. **Full-Fledged Spending Wallet**
   - Captures float and transaction margins
   - Becomes primary payment method
   - Path to "Legacy" company status

## The Business Model

### Revenue Streams

#### 1. FiCore Credits (FC) - Our Internal Currency
- **What:** Virtual currency for premium features and services
- **Pricing:** ₦1 = 1 FC (1:1 parity for simplicity)
- **Initial Balance:** New users start with **10 FC** (welcome bonus)
- **Use Cases:** 
  - Premium subscription payments
  - VAS transaction fees (future)
  - Merchant payments (future)
- **Advantage:** Zero gateway fees, instant settlement, higher margins
- **Strategy:** Small initial balance creates urgency to either subscribe (unlimited) or purchase more FC

#### 2. Wallet Deposit Fees
- **Deposit Fee:** ₦30 per deposit (free tier users only)
- **Gateway Fees:** 1.6% (Monnify standard rate)
- **Premium Benefit:** ₦0 deposit fee (waived for premium subscribers)
- **Strategy:** Loss leader to build wallet balance (future float revenue)
- **Example:** 
  - Free user deposits ₦1,000 → Gateway fee ₦16 → Deposit fee ₦30 → User gets ₦970 FC
  - Premium user deposits ₦1,000 → Gateway fee ₦16 → Deposit fee ₦0 → User gets ₦1,000 FC
- **Net Revenue:** ₦14 per deposit (₦30 fee - ₦16 gateway cost)

#### 3. Subscription Revenue
- **Monthly Premium:** ₦1,000/month
  - 30-day duration
  - Unlimited entries
  - Zero deposit fees (saves ₦30 per deposit)
  - Advanced tax reports
  - Priority support
  - Export capabilities
  
- **Annual Premium:** ₦10,000/year (₦833/month - saves ₦2,000)
  - 365-day duration
  - All monthly features
  - 2 months free
  - Annual tax filing support
  
- **Payment Methods:**
  - Card/Bank (via Monnify/Paystack) - 1.6% gateway fee
  - FiCore Wallet (via FC) - 0% gateway fee ✅ Higher margin
  
- **Unit Economics:**
  - Monthly via card: ₦1,000 - ₦16 (1.6%) = ₦984 net
  - Monthly via wallet: ₦1,000 - ₦0 = ₦1,000 net (100% margin)
  - Annual via card: ₦10,000 - ₦160 (1.6%) = ₦9,840 net
  - Annual via wallet: ₦10,000 - ₦0 = ₦10,000 net (100% margin)

#### 4. VAS Commissions (Airtime/Data/Bills)

**Current Policy:** Face value pricing (no markup to users)

**Commission Rates:**
- **Data Plans:**
  - Peyflex: 5% commission (preferred for data)
  - Monnify: 3% commission
  
- **Airtime:**
  - Monnify: 3% commission (preferred for airtime)
  - Peyflex: 1% commission

**Volume Strategy:**
- Small commissions × High frequency = Sustainable revenue
- Average user: 10-15 VAS transactions/month
- Example: ₦50,000 monthly VAS volume × 3-5% = ₦1,500-₦2,500 revenue/user/month

**User Choice Philosophy:**
- Transparent pricing (users see both provider prices)
- No artificial nudges or "recommended" badges
- Let API prices guide user choice naturally
- Commission strategy optimized but user-first

#### 5. Referral Program Revenue Impact
- **First Deposit Bonus:** ₦30 deposit fee waived + 5 FC (cost to us)
- **Subscription Commission:** ₦2,000 per referred subscription (7-day vesting)
- **VAS Share:** 1% of referee's VAS transactions for 90 days
- **Minimum Withdrawal:** ₦1,000

#### 6. Future Revenue Streams (Phase 3)
- **Float Revenue:** Interest on wallet balances (when licensed)
- **Merchant Fees:** 0.5-1% on business transactions
- **OCR Premium:** ₦500/month for unlimited receipt scanning
- **Open Banking Sync:** ₦200/month per connected bank account
- **API Access:** B2B revenue from accountants/bookkeepers

### Unit Economics Summary

**Per User Monthly Revenue Potential:**
- Subscription: ₦1,000 (or ₦833 if annual)
- Deposit fees: ₦30 × 3 deposits = ₦90 (free tier only)
- VAS commissions: ₦50,000 volume × 4% avg = ₦2,000
- **Total potential:** ₦3,000-₦3,900/user/month

**Margin Optimization:**
- Wallet payments: 100% margin (₦0 gateway fees)
- Card payments: 98.4% margin (1.6% gateway fees)
- VAS commissions: 100% margin (provider pays us)
- Deposit fees: 46.7% margin (₦14 net after ₦16 gateway cost)

### Market Timing Strategy
- **March 31 (PIT Deadline):** Viral trigger for individual upgrades
- **June 30 (CIT Deadline):** Corporate subscription surge
- **Tax Season = Growth Season**

### Scale Factor
**The 10,000th user costs us almost nothing to serve**

- Automated record generation
- Self-service tax dashboard
- Volume + Math engine (not labor-intensive)

## Closing Reflection

**"We are no longer just managing data; we are managing the lifeblood of our users' businesses."**

The transition from Passive Recorder to Active Spender to Everyday Necessity is not just a product roadmap—it's a fundamental shift in how Nigerians think about money management.

When a user buys data at 7 AM, pays for breakfast at 9 AM, and settles a supplier invoice at 2 PM—all through FiCore—and their tax dashboard updates automatically in the background... that's when we've achieved our mission.

That's when bookkeeping becomes invisible.  
That's when compliance becomes automatic.  
That's when FiCore becomes indispensable.
